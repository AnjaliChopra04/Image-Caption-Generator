# Image Caption Generator
This project is based on an inherent CNN model that allocates a caption to the given image

### Description
Image caption generator is a process of recognizing the context of an image and annotating it with relevant captions using deep learning, and computer vision.

Human brain is capable of annotating or labelling an image whenever it comes in front of us. This model processes an image and label it with a highly accurate and relevant caption. With the enhancement of Deep learning and Computer Vision algorithms, availability of AI models, and relevant datasets, this model acts as an accurate caption generator for an image.

Image Captioning is the process of generating a textual description of an image. It uses the principles of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision to generate accurate captions for the given images.
